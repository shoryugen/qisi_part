# CS4261-AndroidClient

**TODO**

- change the design to be compliant with the mockups
- get real location
- activity for a specific place
- integrate live medias

NB: I used Volley as a lib for the request to the web service, but they do not distribute a .jar 
You have to clone their project with:

	git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley

Then import this project as a module in the project to be able to compile it
